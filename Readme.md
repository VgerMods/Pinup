# Pinup

A small addon to let you use `/way` commands without TomTom or any other addons.

**Not compatible with WoW Classic.**

## Installation

 Pinup is installed like every other World of Warcraft mod. Extract the contents of the zip file to World of Warcraft's AddOns folder, generally located in one of these places:

* C:\Users\Public\Games\World of Warcraft\\\_retail_\Interface\AddOns
* C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\\\_retail_\Interface\AddOns
* C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\\\_retail_\Interface\AddOns

## Usage

```
/way 24.8 26.2
/way Nazmir 42.8 26.2
/way #1970 67.4 25.1
```

Note that the game's built-in feature only supports a single active map pin at a time, so you can't paste in a block of them the way that some comments on Wowhead suggest.

## Feedback

I'm not planning on adding a lot of features to this addon, but if you find something that doesn't work the way it should, feel free to reach out:

## Version history

### Version 1.0.2

* Added support for specifying the map ID as a number as Wowhead does now: `/way #1970 67.4 25.1 Firim in Exile, Part 6`.
* Fixed a harmless bug where sometimes the text "Found roughly this many maps" would appear the first time you used Pinup in a play session.

### Version 1.0.1

* Added support for European-style coordinates, such as `/way 24,8 26,2`.

### Version 1.0.0

* Updated for WoW 9.0.5.

### Version 0.0.1

* First public test version of Pinup.
* Special thanks to Gardios for the addon's name.
