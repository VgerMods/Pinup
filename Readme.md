# Pinup

A small addon to let you use `/way` commands without TomTom or any other addons.

**Not compatible with WoW Classic.**

## Installation

 Pinup is installed like every other World of Warcraft mod. Extract the contents of the zip file to World of Warcraft's AddOns folder, generally located in one of these places:

* C:\Users\Public\Games\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns
* C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns
* C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns

## Usage

```
/way 24.8 26.2
/way Nazmir 42.8 26.2
```

Note that the game's built-in feature only supports a single active map pin at a time, so you can't paste in a block of them the way that some comments on Wowhead suggest.

## Feedback

I'm not planning on adding a lot of features to this addon, but if you find something that doesn't work the way it should, feel free to reach out:

* Send me a message on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/vgermods)

* Email vger at vgermods.com
